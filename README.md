# Multi-Document Chat (LLMOps / RAG)

This repository supports **two parallel execution modes** for the same application:

1. **Local development via Docker Compose (localhost)**
2. **Production-style deployment on Hugging Face Spaces (Docker Space)**

Both modes run the application inside containers, but they are intentionally **separated** to avoid coupling local tooling with Hugging Face constraints.

## Repository Structure

```text
.
├── localhost/
│   ├── docker-compose.yml
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   └── ... (local-only configs, volumes, helpers)
│
├── app.py                # HF Spaces entrypoint
├── Dockerfile            # HF Spaces Docker image
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
└── ... (shared application code)
```

### Key Design Decision

* **`localhost/`** is exclusively for local development and testing
* **Repository root** is optimized for **Hugging Face Spaces**

They serve different runtimes and must not be merged.

---

## Local Development (Docker Compose)

The `localhost/` folder allows you to run the full application locally inside Docker using **docker-compose**.

### Characteristics

* Uses `docker-compose.yml`
* Can spin up multiple services (API, vector DB, tools, etc.)
* Suitable for:

  * Rapid iteration
  * Debugging
  * Volume mounting
  * Local experimentation

### Run Locally

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This mode is **not** used by Hugging Face Spaces and is ignored during HF deployment.

---

## Hugging Face Spaces Deployment (Docker)

Hugging Face Spaces builds and runs the application using **only the repository root**.

### Required Files (Root)

* `app.py` → **mandatory entrypoint**
* `Dockerfile` → defines the HF Space image
* `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies

HF Spaces:

* Does **not** use `docker-compose`
* Builds a **single container**
* Exposes the app based on what `app.py` launches

### Deployment Flow

1. Push repository to Hugging Face Spaces
2. HF detects `Dockerfile`
3. Image is built automatically
4. `app.py` is executed inside the container

No local-only files are required or read.

---

## README.md and HF Spaces

* The `README.md` **does not affect runtime execution**
* It can be freely edited
* It is used only for:

  * Documentation
  * HF Spaces UI metadata (title, description, emoji)

You may add, remove, or restructure this README at any time without breaking deployment.

---

## Important Notes

* Keep **HF-specific files at repository root**
* Keep **local-only tooling inside `localhost/`**
* Do not move `app.py` or root `Dockerfile`
* Do not introduce `docker-compose.yml` at root

This separation is intentional and correct.

---

## Testing

This repository includes a dedicated `tests/` folder for automated testing.

### Test Structure

```text
tests/
├── __init__.py
├── test_*.py
└── ... (unit and integration tests)
```

Tests are written using **pytest** and are designed to validate:

* Core application logic
* RAG / retrieval components
* Data processing and utility functions

### Run Tests Locally

From the repository root:

```bash
pytest
```

Or explicitly:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Tests are intended to be executed **locally or in CI**. They are not required for Hugging Face Spaces runtime execution and are not invoked during HF builds unless you explicitly add them to the Dockerfile.
